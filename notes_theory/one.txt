useState, useEffect
useState -> lets your components remember the values and update it(clicks, form inputs, api results)
useEffect -> yet to understand clearly

const(locker),var,let

mounting in react
When React shows your component (<App />) for the very first time in the browser, thatâ€™s called mounting
(like placing a new item on the screen). ðŸ‘‰ At that moment, React executes the code inside your useEffect.
Because you passed an empty dependency array [], it means: Run this function only once (when the component mounts).
Never run it again unless the component is removed and re-added.
ðŸ”¹ Example Analogy
Imagine opening an app for the first time:
You want to load posts from the server only once at startup.You donâ€™t want to call the server every time the
screen refreshes or re-renders. Thatâ€™s why you wrap your fetch code in useEffect(() => {...}, []).

const formData = new FormData();: This is the essential step for uploading files. The FormData object is a native
browser API used to construct a set of key/value pairs representing fields in a web form, which can then be sent
via AJAX (like with Axios).
